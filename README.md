 Password Generator
### This is a collaborative effort in builiding a password generator.

Welcome and thank you for checking out our password generator project.
The project contains a welcome page that explains about password security
and how important it is to be safe on the internet. There is also a button that
leads to another page to the main generator.

## Things Learned.

This project laid out a lot of concepts that we went over in the class including
but not limited to, arrays, for loops, dom manipulation, funcftions, and ect. The
generator takes a sequence of values with unicode values that are set up into 
arrays, then passed through a loop, then assigned an eventlistner with the
click function wich is linked to the value of input.  This was very challenging but
a good reminder or the fundamentals.
